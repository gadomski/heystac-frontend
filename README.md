## Developing

Get [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/).
Then:

```shell
yarn install
yarn dev
```

**heystac** is hosted with [Github Pages](https://github.com/gadomski/heystac/deployments/github-pages).

### Frontend

The frontend is built in [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), using [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Development Seed's UI components](https://ui.ds.io).
The frontend code lives in [app](./app/).

### Backend

We have our own Rust command-line interface (CLI), also called **heystac**, for generating pre-rendered content.
To run:

```shell
yarn build
```

Under the hood, the prebuild script does this:

```shell
cargo run -- prebuild
```

The Rust code for the prebuild script lives in [src](./src/).
